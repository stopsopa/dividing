[demo](https://stopsopa.github.io/dividing)

This is an experiment in building something using a “vibe coding” style - something for which an LLM likely had low chance of finding working example on the internet, meaning it can’t just harvest and use it in this project.

In this case, it’s the implementation of long division some of us were taught at school.

And indeed, the initial implementation had some bugs. Unfortunately, there’s no good way to explain to the AI what’s wrong to fix those issues.

Try taking a look at CLAUDE.md yourself - good luck.
