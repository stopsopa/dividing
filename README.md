This is an example of vibe coding — something for which there’s a low chance of finding working examples on the internet for AI to harvest and regurgitate into my task.

In this case, it’s the implementation of long division - something some of us were taught in school.

And indeed, until the first implementation was produced, there was no way to explain to the AI in a way it would understand what was wrong with it in order to fix those issues.

Try to take CLAUDE.md yourself and do it from scratch to avoid obvious issues you can observe in the demo.
